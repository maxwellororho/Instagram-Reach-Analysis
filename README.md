# Instagram-Reach-Analysis

Instagram generates a lot of data every day. When content creators post on Instagram, they look at their engagement and reach to find the category of posts they should post more. I used Instagram Data from kaggle, collected from the account of the founder of Statso. Below are all the features in the data:

Impressions: Number of impressions in a post (Reach)
From Home: Reach from home
From Hashtags: Reach from Hashtags
From Explore: Reach from Explore
From Other: Reach from other sources
Saves: Number of saves
Comments: Number of comments
Shares: Number of shares
Likes: Number of Likes
Profile Visits: Numer of profile visits from the post
Follows: Number of Follows from the post
Caption: Caption of the post
Hashtags: Hashtags used in the post

The objective was to analyze and predict the reach of this Instagram account to find out how Instagram works.

I utilized Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python which is a Data Science concept where we analyze a dataset to discover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. It helps us better understand the information contained in the dataset and guides us in making informed decisions and formulating strategies to solve real business problems.
